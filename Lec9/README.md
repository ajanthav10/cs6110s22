1) The german.m protocol is one (celebrated) example in Murphi, and a makefile that goes with it is also in this directory (german.m)
   See bit.ly/cs6110s22 (class syllabus page) for tutorials on the German protocol and also on Murphi
   
2) Also provided is the exact same locking protocol we are studying in Promela, now being described in Murphi
   THIS PROTOCOL IS BUGGY:
   - Hence we call it buggy_murphi_locking.m -- the error trace is at the end
   So far these versions are created:
   - fix1_murphi_locking.m -- also buggy     -- the error trace is at the end
   - other fixes under investigation
     (might appear in Asg4 if I manage to fix it and find that the fix is reasonable)
